**Spring_3 Web MVC Homework**

**Required:**
1. Migrate functionality related to core business logic of Servlet-based application to newly created Spring MVC 
project adapting the old one to the correct package structure, naming conventions, etc.:
      _	get rid of all JSP views (now your service will be consuming and populating only JSON text format)
      	make your service RESTful (don't implement HATEOAS logic for now. It will be accomplished in the scope of 
next lecture)
      	the best approach is to start from the scratch and create an empty Spring Boot project using the 
'Spring Initializr'.
      	avoid code copypaste from the old project, unless it relates to the business logic._

2. Create DTO classes and use them at the controller level.
3. Add logging to all layers of the application.

**Optional (would be a great plus):**
1. Use any of available open source mapping tool in order to remap from business classes to DTO and vice versa 
(BeanUtils, MapStruct, etc.)
